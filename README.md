# React + TypeScript + Vite

# Project Title: My Vite React Playground

# Description:
Welcome to My Vite React Playground! This project serves as an exploration and experimentation ground to compare the features and performance of Vite and Create React App. With Create React App being deprecated, Vite emerges as a modern, fast, and lightweight alternative for React development.

# Key Features:

__Vite Development Server:__ Harness the power of Vite's blazing-fast development server for quick feedback during development.
__Instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement):__ Experience instant module updates without full-page reloads, enhancing the development experience.
__Optimized Build:__ Vite's optimized build process ensures quick and efficient production builds, delivering optimal performance.
__React Integration:__ Leverage the seamless integration of Vite with React to build scalable and maintainable React applications.
__Comparison with Create React App:__ Explore and compare the differences in development speed, build times, and overall developer experience between Vite and Create React App.
__Goals:__

Evaluate the development speed and efficiency of Vite compared to Create React App.
Assess the performance gains achieved with Vite's optimized build process.
Gain insights into how Vite enhances the development workflow for React projects.

Note: This project is for testing purposes and aims to provide insights into the benefits of Vite for React development. Share your feedback and discoveries with the community as we embrace the future of modern React tooling.



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
